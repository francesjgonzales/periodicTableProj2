            Matter is the stuff around you. Matter is the air you breathe, the water you drink, the ground you walk on, the flowers you smell, and the food you taste. Any object you can see, smell, or touch is made of matter. There are also very small pieces of matter that you can’t see or touch. Chemists use special equipment to study those little guys. Scientists theorize all of the matter we can observe makes up about 5% of the Universe. The rest is made of dark matter and dark energy.<br><br>
            
            <p id='subHeader'>There are two main qualities of matter.  </p>
                      
            <p id='para'><mark>Matter takes up space.</mark> Even the smallest particles and pieces of atoms take up some space. <mark>Matter also has a mass.</mark> Technically, mass is the amount of matter you have. For now, you can think of mass in terms of weight. You don’t need chemistry to tell you an elephant has a lot of mass, a butterfly has less mass, and an atom has even less mass. Holding an object will tell you the object’s weight and give you a good idea of its mass when compared to other objects.<br><br>
            
              Just so you know, <mark>mass and weight are different.</mark> Mass is an amount of matter that is the same everywhere in the Universe. One kilogram of iron (Fe) will have the same mass on the Earth or the Moon. Weight is based on the gravity of the environment. That kilogram of iron will weigh more on the Earth because the Earth has a stronger gravity than the Moon. Since Jupiter is much larger than the Earth (stronger gravitational force), the weight of that iron on Jupiter will be much heavier. The mass will be the same.</p>

               <p id="history">The name derives from the Greek word hydro for water and genes for forming because it burned in air to form water. Hydrogen was discovered by the English physicist Henry Cavendish in 1766.
                 Scientists had been producing hydrogen for years before it was recognized as an element. Written records indicate that Robert Boyle produced hydrogen gas as early as 1671 while experimenting with iron and acids. Hydrogen was first recognized as a distinct element by Henry Cavendish in 1766.Composed of a single proton and a single electron, hydrogen is the simplest and most abundant element in the universe. It is estimated that 90% of the visible universe is composed of hydrogen.</p>

                Carbon, the sixth most abundant element in the universe, has been known since ancient times. Carbon is most commonly obtained from coal deposits, although it usually must be processed into a form suitable for commercial use. Three naturally occurring allotropes of carbon are known to exist: amorphous, graphite and diamond.</p>

               <p id="history">The name derives from the Greek oxys for acid and genes for forming because the French chemist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier once thought that oxygen was integral to all acids.Oxygen was discovered independently by the Swedish pharmacist and chemist Carl-Wilhelm Scheele in 1771, and the English clergyman and chemist Joseph Priestley in 1774. Scheele's Chemical Treatise on Air and Fire was delayed in publication until 1777, so Priestley is credited with the discovery because he published first. The name oxygen was created by Antoine Lavoisier. Its atomic weight was used as a standard of comparison for each of the other elements until 1961 when the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry adopted carbon 12 as the new basis.</p>

Nitrogen was discovered by the Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. It is the fifth most abundant element in the universe and makes up about 78% of the earth's atmosphere, which contains an estimated 4,000 trillion tons of the gas. Nitrogen is obtained from liquefied air through a process known as fractional distillation. He removed oxygen and carbon dioxide from air and showed that the residual gas would not support combustion or living organisms. At the same time there were other noted scientists working on the problem of nitrogen. These included Scheele, Cavendish, Priestley, and others. They called it burnt or dephlogisticated air, which meant air without oxygen.</p>

          <p id='para'><br>
             All atoms have the same basic parts <mark>(electrons, protons, and neutrons)</mark>, but they are arranged in different ways. Because they have different numbers of parts, atoms of each element have different masses. Hydrogen (H) has an average atomic mass of 1 while carbon (C) is about 12 and calcium (Ca) is about 40.<br><br>
            
            You might say, “Why doesn’t chemistry focus on electrons? Shouldn’t chemists work with the smallest pieces of matter?” Yes, electrons are smaller than atoms and there are subatomic particles that are smaller than electrons. But those teeny-tiny particles don’t have the properties of an element. When the small parts are combined into atoms, chemists can start to see properties and patterns in their behavior.

          <p id='para'><br>
      
            We want to say the atoms are exactly the same, but that’s not quite true. An element is made of atoms that have the same number of protons. If you have a batch of atoms and they all have the same number of <mark>protons</mark>, they are all one element.<br><br>
            
            For example, if the atoms all have four protons, they are beryllium (Be) atoms. Some of those atoms may have four electrons (neutral). Some atoms may have three electrons, leaving the atom with a positive charge (ions). Those ions are still considered beryllium atoms. <mark>Neutrons</mark> work the same way. You may have four neutrons, but you might also have three or five neutrons. Atoms with the same number of protons and different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes of an element. Isotopes and ions are still the same element even though they have different numbers of neutrons and electrons.</p>

            For example, a chemistry experiment might study a rusting pipe. The pipe starts out as iron (Fe). Over time, the pipe begins to oxidize and iron oxide (Fe2O3) is formed. The basic particles of matter are still the same. Orbiting electrons are still electrons and protons in the nucleus are still protons, but their locations and connections have changed. Two iron atoms are bonded to three oxygen (O) atoms with covalent bonds. As we said, chemistry studies the formation and destruction of the chemical bonds between the iron and oxygen atoms.</p>
